## Purpose:
    Emulate a machine language simulator by reading a file and performing the written operation with the given operands.

        -MOV will load the given value into the given register

        -ADDS will add two operands and save the results into the given register

        -SUBS will subtract two operands and save the results into the given register

        -ANDS will perform an AND operaton and save results into the given register

        -ORRS will perform an ORR operaton and save results into the given register

        -XOR will perform an XOR operaton and save results into the given register

        -LSRS will perform a logic shift right a number of times and save results into the given register

        -LSLS will perform a logic shift left a number of times and save results into the given register






## How to Run Program/Additonal Notes:
    -This program is in C++, so to run it, you need to type this in the terminal:
        - make
        - ./output

    -The file that is being read from is "Programming-Project-3.txt"
    -The NZCV flags are messed up.
